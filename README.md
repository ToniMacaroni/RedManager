# RedManager

The RedManager is a general tool for installing/uninstalling/updating different features
of the [RedLoader](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/RedLoader) ecosystem as well as general Sons of the Forest modding features.

Currently it (hopefully) does the job. But in the future it should be able to fully manage your mods and other content.

## Getting Started
**[DOWNLOAD HERE](https://github.com/ToniMacaroni/RedManager/releases)**  
You are probably here to install the RedLoader. To do that:
1) Start the RedManager.
2) The manager should automatically detect your path. If not, you can set it manually.
3) Click on the "Install RedLoader" button.

If you want to double check the installation, check if the following files exist in your game directory:
- `_RedLoader` folder
- `dobby.dll` file
- `version.dll` file

## Additional Features
Beyond the above mentioned features, the RedManager can also:
- Clear any data from old loaders.
- *For modders*: Install the extended UnityExplorer.
- *For modders*: Setup the mod template and quickly create new projects.
